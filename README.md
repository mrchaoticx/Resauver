# Resauver
A better debug console library for JavaScript.

Say we have 3 variables I, X, and H. We need to log these vairables for testing. 
```js
const i = 1;
const x = 2;
const h = 3;
```
We need to log these vairables for testing. Some would do three console log statements. With Resauver you only need one line for your output. 

```js
//What we do.
js(i, x, h);

//What you do.
console.log(i)
console.log(x)
console.log(h)

```

Using our method makes code less messy and debugging easy.
